#DataTrained Evaluation Projects


This Repository contains project done as part of PG Program in Data Science, Machine Learning & Neural Networks in collaboration with IBM. During the course we had to submit 11 projects for evaluation purpose.
The projects include data cleaning, data wrangling, data preprocessing, data encoding, data visualization, statistical description of data etc. and building a machine learning model according to the problem statement based on the clean dataset, training and testing the machine learning model and hyperparameter tuning. The datasets were given by the institution only.


The repository also contains a pdf file which is one of the projects we had to submit in which we have to right a blog of around 2000 words on any of the other previous projects that we had done. In that blog-post, I had go through the whole process of creating a machine learning model from loading the dataset to saving the best model on the customer churn dataset from IBM Sample Data Sets. It provides information on the churn rate of customers, summarized according to Age, Tenure, Contract, Monthly charges, Total charges and other features.
